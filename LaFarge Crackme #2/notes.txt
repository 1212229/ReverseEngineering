0) ignore the first character of the username

1) xor the bytes of the username against 0xAA, 0x89, 0xC4, 0xFE, 0x46
after each xor replace the xor byte with the username character that it was xor'ed
against

2) xor the already xored username from RIGHT to LEFT with these bytes per character 0x78, 0xF0, 0xd0, 0x3, 0xE7 and each xor is done, store the Plain text character
in the key byte array 

3) looks like the same as 1) with these bytes for the XOR 0xF7, 0xFD, 0xF4, 0xE7, 0xB9

4) same as 2) with these keys RIGHT TO LEFt 0xB5 0x1B 0xC9 0x50 0x73

5) adding in a loop of 4 (0,1,2,3) a byte array of [0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00] 
after each iteration, place the sum into the respetive array position

6) take that dword value (4 bytes of sums) and divide them by 10
add 48 (0x30) to the lower 1 byte of the remainder
move the last byte of the sum to a new array (the answer)

7) reverse the answer to get the final answer
